## 📋 Overview
This project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of heart failure using machine learning. Built as part of our software engineering project, the system leverages advanced models and a user-friendly interface to deliver accurate predictions and insights.

## 🌟 Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a trained model for heart failure prediction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Powered by Streamlit for a smooth and interactive experience.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Input patient data and get instant results.
- **Deployed on the Web**: Accessible online from any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python-based web framework)
- **Backend**: Google Colab for model training and Streamlit for deployment
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy for data analysis and model building
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Input Patient Data**: Enter clinical data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.
2. **Model Prediction**: The machine learning model processes the input and predicts the likelihood of heart failure.
3. **View Results**: The result is displayed with additional information and recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset
We utilized a publicly available dataset for heart failure prediction, ensuring high-quality data preprocessing and feature engineering to optimize the model.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or above
